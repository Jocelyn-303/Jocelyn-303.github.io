### CPSC 120

* Lab 4, part 2

    This was one of my favorite labs because I love guessing games that are fun
    and interactive. I also like that it’s a simpler game between two players
    and not the computer making the guess.  I learned to make if statements with
    less than and greater than conditions. I also liked thinking about the
    simplest way to give player two a second chance.

* Lab 7, Part 1

    This was one of my favorite labs because it was more on the complicated side
    and really made you think. I wasn’t super familiar with military time so I
    had to constantly refer back to a reference and also think about the number
    lines for each street parking time. I learned how to write if statements
    within if statements and what bitwise operator would be appropriate.

* Lab 10, part 1

    This was one of my favorite labs because we had to deal with a huge vector
    list of vectors that had a bunch of information for different countries. I
    learned how to transverse through a vector and use .at(0) to find a specific
    index within the vector. I also learned how to use stoi to convert strings
    into integers that we pulled from the vector.
